Absolute path --
Absolute path means that it's always appended right after your domain.

Domain -- raman.com

and if you are currently at raman.com/posts then absolute path would mean raman.com/new-post

Whereas relative path would mean --
if you are currently at raman.com/posts then relative path would mean raman.com/posts/new-post

And to set it to relative path we need get the current path and append our route to it...
