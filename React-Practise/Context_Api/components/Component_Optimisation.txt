 Also if we need componentDidMount() in React hooks useEffect() then pass an empty array as an argument
 to it along with function so it will only run at initialising once and not afterwards

   --------------------------------------------------------
  /* OPTIMISATION CONCEPT */

   Also shouldComponentUpdate can help save us some performance by checking old and new props and preventing
   some re-renders .....
   As by default it checks every time whether virtual dom is changed or not, if yes then reflect it in real dom also

   This shouldComponentUpdate is not available in functional components when using react hooks i.e. useEffect
  So, in that case we use React.memo, actually wrap the component with it while exporting...
  This basically uses memoisation, it is a technique where react will memoise or store a snapshot of this component
  and only if its input changes i.e. props elements then it will rerender it otherwise if inputs don't change and same parent
  component wants to update it, react will give back that stored snapshot of component thus saving rerenders.. 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Pure Component is just a normal component that already implements shouldComponentUpdate with a complete
props check
