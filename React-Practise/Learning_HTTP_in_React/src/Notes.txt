Absolute path --
Absolute path means that it's always appended right after your domain.

Domain -- raman.com

Then absolute path is -- raman.com/new-post  for (/new-post)
and if you are currently at raman.com/posts then absolute path would mean raman.com/new-post

Whereas relative path would mean --
if you are currently at raman.com/posts then relative path would mean raman.com/posts/new-post

when we set to or pathname in <Link> then it is by default set to absolute path 
And to set it to relative path we need get the current path and append our route to it...
for which we use `this.props.match.url` .....



We use `Link` in normal links and `NavLink` when we need to set active Route by providing css Class



Route Parameters==

/:id   with colon 
It is accessed via `props.match.params.id`


Query Parameters or Search==

/?something=somevalue
It is accessed via `props.location.search`
But this will only give us something like ?start=5 

We probably want to get the key-value pair, without the ?  and the = . 
Here's a snippet which allows us to easily extract that information:

    componentDidMount() {
        const query = new URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search);
        for (let param of query.entries()) {
            console.log(param); // yields ['start', '5']
        }
    }

URLSearchParams  is a built-in object, shipping with vanilla JavaScript. 
It returns an object, which exposes the entries()  method. 
entries()  returns an Iterator - basically a construct which can be used in a for...of...  loop.

When looping through query.entries() , we get arrays where the first element is the key name (e.g. start ) 
and the second element is the assigned value (e.g. 5 ).`


Fragments==

/#something
It is accessed via `props.location.hash`


history, location, match, etc. props are available only in components that are rendered by the <Route />
of react-router-dom and not in their child components or the components being called by them.

So we have to pass them manually, or we can do so by a special hoc withRouter() method in the child component.

Also these history, match, etc. props are available in components that are rendered through Route inside Browser router
But only those have these props that are rendered using component={App} in <Route />
And those rendered using render(() => <App />) don't have these props so we can do one thing like creating a new
history object and passing it as props to the component
