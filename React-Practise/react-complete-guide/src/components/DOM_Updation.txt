render() method does not directly re-render original dom or browser dom

This re rendering is prevented by shouldComponentUpdate or memo() when props don't change
But still if props change and there is no change it will not rerender original dom
Rather it checks or compares virtual doms old and new one created by JSX..

It uses this as this Virtual dom comparing is faster than real doms

If it find any differences in virtual doms, then it reaches out the real DOM and updates it...
And even then it doesn't re render real DOM entirely, rather it only do changes at places where differences 
are detected...

And if no differences are found, it doesn't touch the real DOM..
