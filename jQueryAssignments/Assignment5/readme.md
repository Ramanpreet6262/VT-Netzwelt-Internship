# Assignment 5

“Product Comparison”: There is a list of products shown in the page with a checkbox named “Add to compare”.
Clicking on the checkbox should select that product and add it to another ```<div>``` in the right side of the screen 
with vertical column which will show that product's image & name.
Clicking on another checkbox of product will add another product to that “Vertical” ```<div>``` tag
and when there are two products, we will show the “Compare” button as well. 
There should be an option to delete the product from comparison with “cross” symbol on each image of that vertical ```<div>```.
Clicking on compare button should show the “Modal” window with the details of that product in the difference.
